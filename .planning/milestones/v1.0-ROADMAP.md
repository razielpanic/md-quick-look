**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 30

## Overview

Deliver a working Quick Look extension for macOS that renders markdown files with essential formatting in Finder. Start with extension foundation and macOS integration, build core markdown rendering capabilities for all basic elements, add table support for GitHub-flavored markdown compatibility, and polish with performance optimization and system appearance support.

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SYSINT-01, SYSINT-03
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create Xcode project with host app and Quick Look extension, implement PreviewViewController
- [x] 01-02: Create build automation (Makefile) and verify extension works in Finder

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can select a .md file in Finder and press spacebar to trigger Quick Look
2. Quick Look extension launches and displays markdown content (even if basic/unstyled)
3. Extension works on macOS 26 (Tahoe) and later versions

### Phase 3: Tables & Advanced Elements

**Goal**: Render GitHub-flavored markdown tables
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: MDRNDR-09
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Create TableExtractor and TableRenderer infrastructure
- [x] 03-02: Integrate hybrid rendering in MarkdownRenderer with visual verification

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User sees markdown tables rendered with rows, columns, and borders
2. User sees table headers visually distinguished from table body rows

3. REQUIREMENTS.md marks SYSINT-02 and SYSINT-04 as complete

**Completion:** 2026-02-02

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- AttributedString → NSAttributedString conversion: AttributedString font/color are SwiftUI-specific; NSAttributedString for AppKit
- Custom attributes for PresentationIntent bridging: PresentationIntent doesn't bridge to NSAttributedString; use custom attributes like .blockquoteMarker
- LayoutManager custom drawing for backgrounds/borders: Achieves uniform appearance instead of per-line jagging from inline backgroundColor
- Hybrid table rendering: Source range splitting preserves document structure; NSTextTable provides proper table layout
- 500KB truncation threshold: Supports large documentation files while guaranteeing <1s render time
- System semantic colors: All NSColor instances use semantic colors for automatic dark mode support

**Issues Resolved:**

- Image placeholder markers being modified by AttributedString parser (solved with plain text approach)
- List item spacing issues from inline formatting splits (solved with ordinal tracking pattern)
- Blockquote multi-paragraph continuity (solved with identity tracking and soft break preprocessing)
- Code block and blockquote background/border gaps (solved with LayoutManager custom drawing)
- Quick Look scrolling disabled (solved with NSTextView vertical scrolling configuration)
- Large file hangs (solved with FileHandle partial reading and 500KB truncation)

**Issues Deferred:**

None - all v1.0 requirements satisfied

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - production-ready codebase with zero tech debt
