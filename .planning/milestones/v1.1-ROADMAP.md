# Milestone v1.1: Public Release (GitHub)

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 6-10
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

v1.1 transforms the working Quick Look extension (v1.0) into a polished, publicly distributable macOS application via GitHub. The journey spans five phases: clean up all naming artifacts from development, design a professional app icon, build SwiftUI host app UI (About/Preferences windows), package into a DMG for GitHub release, and create comprehensive documentation with screenshots and demo GIFs showing the "spacebar to preview" magic moment.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Naming Cleanup

**Goal**: Remove all legacy "spotlighter" references and establish consistent "MD Quick Look" naming
**Depends on**: Nothing (prerequisite for all v1.1 work)
**Requirements**: NAMING-01, NAMING-02, NAMING-03, NAMING-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Complete codebase rename (directories, bundle IDs, Swift files, Makefile)
- [x] 06-02: GitHub repository rename
- [x] 06-03: Planning documentation update

**Details:**
- Renamed entire Xcode project structure from md-quick-look to MDQuickLook
- Updated all bundle identifiers to com.rocketpop.MDQuickLook pattern
- Two-step git mv for macOS case-sensitive renames
- Single atomic commit for clean before/after boundary
- GitHub repo renamed with automatic redirect from old URL

### Phase 7: App Icon Design

**Goal**: Professional app icon that represents markdown preview functionality
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: ICON-01, ICON-02, ICON-03, ICON-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Create master icon and generate all sizes
- [x] 07-02: Integrate into Xcode project and verify display

**Details:**
- Geometric star/octothorpe composition using ImageMagick
- Purple gradient (#6B46C1 to #553C9A) with frosted glass effect
- Carved-out effect via Dst_Out compositing for visual depth
- 1024x1024 master icon with all 10 required macOS sizes
- Integrated into Assets.xcassets, verified in Finder, Dock, and About window

### Phase 8: SwiftUI Host App UI

**Goal**: Professional app UI with About window, Preferences, and extension status indicator
**Depends on**: Phase 7 (needs icon for About window)
**Requirements**: UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04, UI-05, UI-06, UI-07
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01: SwiftUI App entry point with Settings scene and menu bar
- [x] 08-02: About, Preferences, and First-launch views
- [x] 08-03: Visual and functional verification checkpoint
- [x] 08-04: Fix visual styling and System Settings URL (gap closure)
- [x] 08-05: Add Settings scene for menu access (gap closure)

**Details:**
- NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor for lifecycle hooks
- AboutView with version, GitHub link, copyright via Bundle extension
- SettingsView with extension status and System Settings deep link
- FirstLaunchView with welcome message and extension setup guidance
- Semantic colors throughout for automatic dark mode support
- SwiftUI Settings scene for standard Cmd+, shortcut

### Phase 9: Distribution Packaging

**Goal**: Professional unsigned DMG distribution package available on GitHub Releases
**Depends on**: Phase 8 (needs working app to package)
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-03, DIST-04, DIST-05, DIST-06
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 09-01: Version bump to 1.1.0, rebuild app, create unsigned DMG
- [x] 09-02: Release notes and GitHub release v1.1.0 publication

**Details:**
- Version 1.1.0 with build number 2 across all targets
- 3.5MB unsigned DMG with drag-to-install layout via create-dmg
- GitHub release v1.1.0 published (not prerelease) with DMG asset
- Release notes with Gatekeeper bypass instructions and first-launch setup
- DMG files excluded from git (release artifacts only)

### Phase 10: Documentation & Marketing

**Goal**: Comprehensive, engaging documentation that shows users the value and guides installation
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (needs screenshots of app, working installation flow)
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06, DOCS-07
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: LICENSE file, docs directory, and complete README with all sections
- [x] 10-02: Screenshot and demo GIF capture (hero, column view, light/dark mode, demo GIF)

**Details:**
- MIT License with 2026 copyright
- 100-line scannable README with hero screenshot, badges, features, demo GIF
- Three feature screenshots: column view, dark mode, light mode
- Three-tier troubleshooting: Gatekeeper, extension discovery, Finder relaunch
- Manual DMG installation instructions with releases link

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Single atomic commit for renaming (preserves git history, clean before/after boundary)
- Bundle ID pattern com.rocketpop.MDQuickLook with .Extension suffix
- Geometric icon generation over font rendering (no Ghostscript dependency)
- Purple gradient (#6B46C1 to #553C9A) for monochromatic elegance
- NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor for lifecycle hooks (SwiftUI Scene limitations)
- SwiftUI Settings scene for standard macOS Cmd+, behavior
- Direct users to System Settings for extension status (no programmatic check)
- Unsigned release with Gatekeeper bypass (SIGN requirements deferred)
- MIT License for open source distribution
- create-dmg for automated DMG layout

**Issues Resolved:**

- macOS case-sensitive filesystem renames via two-step git mv
- ImageMagick font rendering limitations (switched to geometric primitives)
- SwiftUI API limitations for macOS 14 compatibility
- System Settings deep linking for extension enablement

**Issues Deferred:**

- Code signing and notarization (SIGN-01 through SIGN-06) — deferred to App Store milestone
- Preview pane optimization — deferred to v1.2
- MIT license attribution in app UI — captured as pending todo

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Missing VERIFICATION.md for Phase 7 (documentation gap only, all requirements verified via summaries)
- Unsigned distribution requires manual Gatekeeper bypass
