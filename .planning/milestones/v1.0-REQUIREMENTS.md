## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| macOS 14 or earlier support | Targeting latest OS only (26+), no legacy support needed |
| Clickable links | Breaks preview-only UX; Quick Look is for viewing, not interaction |
| HTML/CSS rendering | Security risk (XSS), complexity not needed for markdown |
| JavaScript execution | Impossible in sandbox, not needed |
| Remote image loading | Network delays, privacy issues, 30s timeout risk |
| Interactive widgets | No edit capability in preview context |
| Mermaid diagrams / MathJax | Requires JavaScript; timeout risk; high complexity |
| Custom CSS/theming | Use system appearance defaults |
| Other file formats | Markdown only |
| Mobile/iPad support | macOS Quick Look extension only |
