**Status:** PASSED

## Scores

| Category | Score | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 28/28 | All active requirements satisfied (SIGN-01–06 deferred by design) |
| Phases | 5/5 | All phases complete with verification |
| Integration | 15/15 | All cross-phase connections wired |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 | All user flows complete without breaks |

## Requirements Coverage

### Naming & Cleanup (Phase 6)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| NAMING-01: Remove spotlighter refs from codebase | ✓ SATISFIED | Grep returns 0 matches in Swift/build files |
| NAMING-02: Remove spotlighter refs from documentation | ✓ SATISFIED | No unintentional references in docs |
| NAMING-03: Consistent bundle identifiers | ✓ SATISFIED | com.rocketpop.MDQuickLook pattern throughout |
| NAMING-04: "MD Quick Look" in all user-facing locations | ✓ SATISFIED | CFBundleName, UI strings, menu bar verified |

### App Icon (Phase 7)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| ICON-01: 1024x1024 master icon | ✓ SATISFIED | scripts/icon_master_1024.png (816KB) |
| ICON-02: All required icon sizes | ✓ SATISFIED | 10 sizes in AppIcon.appiconset |
| ICON-03: Integrated into Assets.xcassets | ✓ SATISFIED | Compiled to 47KB AppIcon.icns |
| ICON-04: Appears in Finder, Dock, About | ✓ SATISFIED | User verified during 07-02 checkpoint |

### App UI (Phase 8)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| UI-01: About window with version | ✓ SATISFIED | Standard About panel with version via Bundle extension |
| UI-02: GitHub link in About | ✓ SATISFIED | Help menu CommandGroup opens GitHub URL |
| UI-03: Credits in About | ✓ SATISFIED | AboutView.swift with copyright and description |
| UI-04: Preferences window | ✓ SATISFIED | Settings scene with Cmd+, shortcut |
| UI-05: First-launch welcome | ✓ SATISFIED | FirstLaunchView with ContentRouter routing |
| UI-06: Extension status display | ✓ SATISFIED | SettingsView and FirstLaunchView show status + deep link |
| UI-07: Light and dark mode | ✓ SATISFIED | Semantic colors throughout, UAT verified both modes |

### Code Signing (Deferred)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| SIGN-01 through SIGN-06 | DEFERRED | Unsigned release by design — documented in ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, and RELEASE_NOTES.md |

**Note:** SIGN requirements were descoped during Phase 9 planning. The release ships unsigned with Gatekeeper bypass instructions. This is documented and intentional — not a gap.

### Distribution (Phase 9)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DIST-01: DMG with create-dmg | ✓ SATISFIED | 3.5MB DMG with icon, background, Applications symlink |
| DIST-02: Unsigned DMG with bypass instructions | ✓ SATISFIED | RELEASE_NOTES.md has 5 Gatekeeper bypass mentions |
| DIST-03: DMG installation verified | ✓ SATISFIED | Human verified download, install, launch |
| DIST-04: GitHub release v1.1.0 | ✓ SATISFIED | Published release, not draft/prerelease |
| DIST-05: DMG attached to release | ✓ SATISFIED | MD.Quick.Look.1.1.0.dmg asset attached |
| DIST-06: Release notes with instructions | ✓ SATISFIED | 75-line RELEASE_NOTES.md with all sections |

### Documentation (Phase 10)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DOCS-01: README with hero screenshot | ✓ SATISFIED | hero-screenshot.png (331KB, 1488x1510) |
| DOCS-02: Installation instructions | ✓ SATISFIED | 4-step manual installation with releases link |
| DOCS-03: Troubleshooting section | ✓ SATISFIED | 3 subsections: Gatekeeper, extension, Finder |
| DOCS-04: Demo GIF | ✓ SATISFIED | demo.gif (932KB, 600x411) |
| DOCS-05: 2-3 feature screenshots | ✓ SATISFIED | 3 screenshots: column, dark, light |
| DOCS-06: LICENSE file | ✓ SATISFIED | MIT License, 2026, Raziel Panic |
| DOCS-07: README scannable | ✓ SATISFIED | 104 lines, 11 sections |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Verification | Status | Score |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 6. Naming Cleanup | 06-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 7/7 |
| 7. App Icon Design | No VERIFICATION.md (summaries only) | PASSED (via summaries) | 4/4 requirements met |
| 8. SwiftUI Host App UI | 08-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 7/7 (after re-verification) |
| 9. Distribution Packaging | 09-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 6/6 |
| 10. Documentation & Marketing | 10-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 7/7 |

**Note:** Phase 7 is missing a formal VERIFICATION.md. Both plan summaries (07-01, 07-02) confirm successful execution and user verification of icon appearance. All ICON requirements satisfied. This is a documentation gap, not a functional gap.
