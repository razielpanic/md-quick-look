## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- macOS 26+ (Tahoe) only: Target latest OS, avoid legacy API complexity
- macOS-only Quick Look extension: True system integration vs. standalone app
- No syntax highlighting in v1: Keep v1 simple and fast, defer to v2
- Include tables in v1, defer images: Tables are text-based (low complexity), images require sandbox workarounds
