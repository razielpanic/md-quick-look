## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

### Pending Todos

1. **Ensure MIT license attribution in app UI** (area: ui) — verify About window and app surfaces include proper MIT attribution
2. **Add Preferences toggle for YAML front matter display** (area: ui) — show/hide machine-targeted metadata via Settings, requires App Group for host<>extension sharing
3. **Fix dark mode background color inconsistency across sections** (area: rendering) — YAML, blockquote, code block fills don't harmonize in dark mode
