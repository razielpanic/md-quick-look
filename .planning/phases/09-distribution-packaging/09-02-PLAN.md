<objective>
Write release notes, create the GitHub v1.1.0 release, attach the DMG, and verify the release is publicly accessible.

Purpose: This is the final step -- making the distribution package available to users. The release notes serve as the first thing users see when downloading, so they must include clear installation instructions and Gatekeeper bypass steps for the unsigned app.
Output: A public GitHub release at https://github.com/razielpanic/md-quick-look/releases/tag/v1.1.0 with the DMG attached.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write release notes and create GitHub release</name>
  <files>
    RELEASE_NOTES.md
  </files>
  <action>
Create RELEASE_NOTES.md in the project root with the following structure (adapt based on actual changes from v1.0 to v1.1):

```markdown
## What's New in v1.1.0

**First public release of MD Quick Look** — a macOS Quick Look extension for beautifully rendered Markdown previews.

### Highlights
- Professional app icon
- SwiftUI host app with About window and Settings
- Extension status indicator with direct link to System Settings
- Complete documentation with screenshots and demo GIF
- Consistent "MD Quick Look" naming throughout

### Full Changelog
- Renamed from development name to "MD Quick Look" across all surfaces
- Added professional purple gradient app icon with markdown motif
- Built SwiftUI host application with About, Preferences, and first-launch views
- Added extension enable/disable guidance via System Settings deep link
- Created comprehensive README with installation guide, troubleshooting, and feature screenshots
- Added MIT license

## Installation

1. Download **MD-Quick-Look-1.1.0.dmg** below
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag **MD Quick Look.app** to **Applications**
4. **Launch the app once** to register the Quick Look extension
5. Select any `.md` file in Finder and press **Space** to preview

## macOS Security Note

This is an unsigned release. macOS Gatekeeper will show a warning on first launch.

**To open (recommended):**
1. Right-click **MD Quick Look.app** in Applications
2. Select **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

**Alternative (Terminal):**
```
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MD\ Quick\ Look.app
```

After this one-time step, the app launches normally.

## Requirements

- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later
```

Adjust the highlights and changelog based on what actually shipped in v1.1. Reference the README for accuracy.

Then create the GitHub release and attach the DMG:

```bash
cd .

# Find the actual DMG filename (may vary slightly from create-dmg output)
DMGFILE=$(ls MD-Quick-Look-*.dmg | head -1)
echo "DMG file: $DMGFILE"

# Create the release, attach DMG
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "v1.1.0 — First Public Release" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md \
  "$DMGFILE#MD Quick Look v1.1.0 (macOS 26+)"
```

Important notes:
- The tag `v1.1.0` will be created on the current HEAD commit of main
- The pre-release v1.1-beta already exists; this v1.1.0 is the final release (NOT a pre-release)
- Do NOT use `--prerelease` flag -- this is the real release
- The `#` syntax after the DMG filename sets the asset label shown on the release page

After creating the release, verify it:
```bash
gh release view v1.1.0
```
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `gh release view v1.1.0` — should show:
- Title contains "v1.1.0"
- draft: false
- prerelease: false
- asset: MD-Quick-Look-*.dmg listed

Run: `cat RELEASE_NOTES.md | grep -c "Installation"` — should be >= 1
Run: `cat RELEASE_NOTES.md | grep -c "Gatekeeper\|quarantine\|right-click\|Right-click"` — should be >= 1
  </verify>
  <done>
RELEASE_NOTES.md exists with installation instructions and Gatekeeper bypass steps. GitHub release v1.1.0 is published (not draft, not pre-release) with DMG attached as downloadable asset.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify GitHub release and DMG installation</name>
  <what-built>
Complete v1.1.0 distribution: version-bumped app packaged into unsigned DMG, published as GitHub release with release notes.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Visit https://github.com/razielpanic/md-quick-look/releases/tag/v1.1.0
2. Confirm the release page shows:
   - Title: "v1.1.0 — First Public Release"
   - Release notes with installation instructions and Gatekeeper bypass
   - DMG file listed as a downloadable asset
3. Download the DMG from the release page
4. Open the DMG -- verify it shows the app icon and Applications folder shortcut
5. Drag the app to Applications (or a test location)
6. Launch the app -- verify About window shows version 1.1.0
7. Test Quick Look: select a .md file in Finder, press Space
8. (Optional) Test on a fresh user account or ask a friend to download and test

If the pre-release v1.1-beta is no longer needed, you can delete it:
```
gh release delete v1.1-beta --yes
```
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the release looks good, or describe any issues (wrong version, missing asset, broken DMG, etc.)</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. RELEASE_NOTES.md exists in project root with installation and Gatekeeper sections
2. `gh release view v1.1.0` shows published release with DMG asset
3. Release page is publicly accessible at the GitHub URL
4. DMG downloads and installs correctly (human verified)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- GitHub release v1.1.0 exists with correct tag
- DMG is attached and downloadable
- Release notes include Gatekeeper bypass instructions
- Human has verified the full download-install-launch flow
</success_criteria>
