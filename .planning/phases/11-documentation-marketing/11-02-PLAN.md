<objective>
Capture hero screenshot, feature screenshots (light/dark mode), and demo GIF showing the "spacebar to preview" magic moment. Optimize all assets for GitHub (screenshots <500KB, GIF <5MB).

Purpose: Visual assets are the most important part of the README - they show users the value proposition instantly without reading text. The hero screenshot is the first thing visitors see.

Output: 4 optimized image assets in docs/ directory that are already referenced by README.md from Plan 11-01.

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Capture hero screenshot</name>
  <action>
    Capture a hero screenshot showing MD Quick Look rendering a markdown file in Finder's Quick Look panel.

    **Setup:**
    1. Open Finder and navigate to a folder containing markdown files (use the `samples/` directory or any folder with `.md` files)
    2. Select a markdown file that demonstrates rich content (headings, bold, lists, code blocks, tables)
       - Recommended: Use `samples/comprehensive.md` or create a sample file with varied markdown elements
    3. Press spacebar to open Quick Look preview
    4. Position the Quick Look panel so it shows clearly against the Finder background

    **Capture:**
    1. Use `Cmd + Shift + 4` then press `Space` to capture just the Quick Look window
       - OR use `Cmd + Shift + 5` for more control over the capture area
    2. Save as `docs/hero-screenshot.png`

    **Optimize:**
    1. Open in Preview.app > Tools > Adjust Size > set Resolution to 72 pixels/inch
    2. OR run through ImageOptim if installed: `open -a ImageOptim docs/hero-screenshot.png`
    3. Verify file size: `ls -lh docs/hero-screenshot.png` (target: <500KB)

    **Quality check:**
    - Screenshot clearly shows rendered markdown (not raw text)
    - Finder context is visible (shows this is Quick Look, not a standalone app)
    - Content is readable at the README display width (800px)
  </action>
  <how-to-verify>
    `ls -lh docs/hero-screenshot.png` exists and is under 500KB
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "done" when hero screenshot is saved to docs/hero-screenshot.png</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Capture feature screenshots (light and dark mode)</name>
  <action>
    Capture two feature screenshots showing markdown rendering in both light and dark mode.

    **Light mode screenshot:**
    1. Set macOS appearance to Light mode (System Settings > Appearance > Light)
    2. Open Finder, select a markdown file with varied content
    3. Press spacebar for Quick Look preview
    4. Capture the Quick Look window: `Cmd + Shift + 4` then `Space`
    5. Save as `docs/feature-light.png`

    **Dark mode screenshot:**
    1. Set macOS appearance to Dark mode (System Settings > Appearance > Dark)
    2. Repeat the same Quick Look preview capture
    3. Save as `docs/feature-dark.png`

    **Optimize both:**
    1. Open each in Preview.app > Tools > Adjust Size > 72 ppi
    2. OR use ImageOptim
    3. Verify: `ls -lh docs/feature-light.png docs/feature-dark.png` (each <500KB)

    **Quality check:**
    - Both screenshots show the same or similar markdown content
    - Light/dark mode difference is clearly visible
    - Content demonstrates multiple markdown elements (headings, code, tables if possible)
  </action>
  <how-to-verify>
    `ls -lh docs/feature-light.png docs/feature-dark.png` both exist and are under 500KB each
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "done" when both feature screenshots are saved</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Record demo GIF</name>
  <action>
    Record a demo GIF showing the complete "spacebar to preview" workflow.

    **Setup:**
    1. Install Kap if not already installed: `brew install --cask kap`
       - OR use CleanShot X if you have it
       - OR use macOS built-in screen recording (Cmd + Shift + 5) and convert to GIF
    2. Open Finder to a folder with markdown files
    3. Practice the flow: select file > press spacebar > preview appears > press spacebar to close

    **Record with Kap:**
    1. Open Kap from menu bar
    2. Select capture area around the Finder window (keep it focused, not full screen)
    3. Start recording
    4. Perform the workflow:
       - Click on a `.md` file to select it
       - Press spacebar (Quick Look preview appears with rendered markdown)
       - Pause briefly so viewer can see the rendered content (2-3 seconds)
       - Press spacebar again to close (optional)
    5. Stop recording
    6. Export as GIF:
       - Set FPS to 10 (screen capture doesn't need high framerate)
       - Set quality to medium-high
    7. Save as `docs/demo.gif`

    **If converting from screen recording:**
    ```bash
    # Using Gifski (brew install gifski)
    gifski --fps 10 --quality 80 -o docs/demo.gif recording.mov

    # Or using ffmpeg
    ffmpeg -i recording.mov -vf "fps=10,scale=600:-1" -loop 0 docs/demo.gif
    ```

    **Optimize:**
    1. Run through ImageOptim: `open -a ImageOptim docs/demo.gif`
    2. Verify: `ls -lh docs/demo.gif` (target: <5MB, ideal: 2-3MB)

    **Quality check:**
    - GIF is under 10 seconds
    - Shows complete workflow: select > spacebar > preview visible
    - Rendered markdown is readable (not too small)
    - File size is under 5MB
    - Loops smoothly (GIF repeats naturally)
  </action>
  <how-to-verify>
    `ls -lh docs/demo.gif` exists and is under 5MB
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "done" when demo GIF is saved to docs/demo.gif</resume-signal>
</task>
