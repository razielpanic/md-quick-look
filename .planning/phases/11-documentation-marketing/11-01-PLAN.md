<objective>
Create the LICENSE file, docs/ directory, and complete README.md with all required sections: hero screenshot placeholder, badges, installation instructions (manual DMG), troubleshooting (quarantine, extension discovery, Finder relaunch), features with screenshot placeholders, demo GIF placeholder, and license reference.

Purpose: Establishes the entire public-facing documentation for the GitHub repository. The README is the first thing potential users see and must communicate value, guide installation, and solve common problems.

Output: LICENSE file, docs/ directory, and complete README.md ready for screenshot/GIF assets to be added in Plan 11-02.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create LICENSE file and docs directory</name>
  <files>LICENSE, docs/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
    1. Create an MIT License file at the project root (`LICENSE`). Use the standard MIT License text with:
       - Year: 2026
       - Copyright holder: "Raziel Panic" (matching the GitHub username razielpanic)
       - Standard MIT License body text (permission notice, warranty disclaimer)

    2. Create a `docs/` directory at the project root with a `.gitkeep` file so git tracks the empty directory. This directory will hold screenshot and GIF assets referenced by the README.

    Do NOT use the GitHub web UI. Write the files directly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `cat LICENSE` shows MIT License text with 2026 and correct copyright holder
    - `ls docs/.gitkeep` confirms docs directory exists
  </verify>
  <done>MIT LICENSE file exists at project root. docs/ directory exists and is tracked by git.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write complete README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Write a complete README.md at the project root following the structure from the research. The README must include ALL of the following sections in order:

    **1. Title + Hero Screenshot:**
    ```markdown
    # MD Quick Look

    > Beautiful markdown previews in Finder. Just press spacebar.

    <p align="center">
      <img src="docs/hero-screenshot.png" alt="MD Quick Look showing rendered markdown in Finder's Quick Look panel" width="800">
    </p>
    ```

    **2. Badges (3 badges):**
    - License: MIT badge linking to LICENSE file
    - macOS: "macOS 26+" badge (this project targets macOS 26 Tahoe)
    - Release: GitHub release badge linking to releases page
    - Use shields.io badge URLs
    - GitHub repo: `razielpanic/md-quick-look`

    **3. Features section:**
    - Bullet list of key features:
      - Headings with visual hierarchy (h1-h6)
      - Bold, italic, and strikethrough text
      - Ordered and unordered lists
      - Code blocks with monospaced font
      - Blockquotes
      - GitHub-flavored markdown tables
      - Links displayed as text
      - Image placeholders
      - Automatic dark mode support
      - Instant rendering (under 1 second)
    - Include 2-3 screenshot placeholders:
      ```markdown
      <p align="center">
        <img src="docs/feature-light.png" alt="Markdown rendering in light mode" width="600">
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        <img src="docs/feature-dark.png" alt="Markdown rendering in dark mode" width="600">
      </p>
      ```

    **4. Demo GIF section ("See It in Action"):**
    ```markdown
    ## See It in Action

    <p align="center">
      <img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="Demo: Select a markdown file in Finder, press spacebar, see rendered preview" width="600">
    </p>

    Select any `.md` file in Finder and press spacebar. That's it.
    ```

    **5. Installation section:**
    - Manual Installation subsection (primary method for now - no Homebrew cask yet):
      1. Download the latest `MD-Quick-Look.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/razielpanic/md-quick-look/releases)
      2. Open the DMG file
      3. Drag MD Quick Look.app to `/Applications`
      4. Launch the app once (required to register the Quick Look extension)
    - Note: Do NOT include a Homebrew section since no cask exists yet. Can add later.

    **6. Troubleshooting section:**
    Include three subsections:

    a. "First Launch Security Warning" - macOS Gatekeeper:
       - Explain the "cannot be opened because developer cannot be verified" warning
       - Solution 1: Right-click > Open > Open
       - Solution 2: Terminal `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MD\ Quick\ Look.app`

    b. "Extension Not Appearing?" - Quick Look extension discovery:
       - Verify app is in /Applications (not ~/Applications or ~/Downloads)
       - Launch the app at least once
       - Check System Settings > Extensions > Quick Look (note: macOS 26 uses "System Settings" not "System Preferences")
       - Enable "MD Quick Look" if unchecked
       - Reload Quick Look: `qlmanage -r`

    c. "Still Not Working?" - Last resort:
       - Restart Finder: Cmd + Option + Esc > Finder > Relaunch
       - Or terminal: `killall Finder`

    **7. Requirements section:**
    - macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later

    **8. License section:**
    - "This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details."

    **Style guidelines:**
    - Keep text concise - bullets over paragraphs
    - Bold key actions and file paths in instructions
    - Use code blocks for all terminal commands
    - Total README should be approximately 100-150 lines (well under 10-12 screens)
    - Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections
    - Add blank lines between sections for breathing room
    - Do NOT add a Contributing section (solo project for now)
    - Do NOT add build-from-source instructions (not needed for end users)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `wc -l README.md` shows approximately 100-150 lines
    - `grep -c "##" README.md` shows 7+ section headings
    - `grep "hero-screenshot" README.md` shows hero image reference
    - `grep "demo.gif" README.md` shows demo GIF reference
    - `grep "feature-light\|feature-dark" README.md` shows feature screenshot references
    - `grep "MIT" README.md` shows license reference
    - `grep "xattr" README.md` shows quarantine troubleshooting command
    - `grep "qlmanage" README.md` shows Quick Look reload command
    - `grep "shields.io" README.md` shows badge URLs
  </verify>
  <done>README.md exists with all required sections: hero screenshot, badges, features with screenshot placeholders, demo GIF, installation, troubleshooting (quarantine + extension discovery + Finder relaunch), requirements, and license. Content is scannable, concise, and under 150 lines.</done>
