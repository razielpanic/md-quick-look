## Current State

Research phase complete. Ready to define requirements and create roadmap.

## Completed Work

- ✓ PROJECT.md created and committed (project vision, core value, scope)
- ✓ config.json created and committed (YOLO mode, Standard depth, Parallel execution, git tracking enabled)
- ✓ Research completed (4 parallel agents):
  - STACK.md: Swift 5.9, QLPreviewProvider, swift-markdown, NSAttributedString rendering
  - FEATURES.md: Table stakes vs differentiators, performance constraints
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Modern Quick Look extension architecture, sandbox constraints
  - PITFALLS.md: 15 documented risks with prevention strategies
  - SUMMARY.md: Synthesized findings with roadmap structure

All research committed to git in `.planning/research/`

## Remaining Work

1. Define requirements (REQUIREMENTS.md) based on research
2. Create roadmap (ROADMAP.md) with phase structure
3. Begin Phase 1 execution

## Key Context

**Project:** Quick Look extension for instant markdown preview in Finder
**User:** Solo developer managing/learning, delegating implementation
**Mode:** YOLO (auto-approve, learning checkpoints offered)

**MVP Scope (from research):**
- Headings, bold/italic, lists, code blocks, blockings, links (text), image placeholders, tables (raw)
- Instant rendering (<1 second)
- No syntax highlighting or image embedding in Phase 1

**Critical insights from research:**
- Sandbox prevents external file access (workaround: embed or placeholder)
- Performance is hard constraint (30s timeout, 120MB memory)
- Code signing complexity requires automation
- NSAttributedString rendering preferred over WebKit for sandbox compatibility

## Next Action

Run one of:
- `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` — Gather context before planning Phase 1
- Resume requirements work manually: review `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` and define v1 requirements

**Or just:** `/gsd:progress` to see current project state
